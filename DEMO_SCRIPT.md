# The Idea Refinery - Demo Script

## Demo Flow (5-7 minutes)

### 1. Introduction (30 seconds)
- "Every great company started as a bad idea that got debated into a good one"
- "The Idea Refinery puts AI agents in a war room to stress-test your idea"
- Show the landing page

### 2. Start a Debate (1 minute)
- Enter idea: **"An AI that helps you pack for trips based on your calendar and weather"**
- Add criteria:
  - "Must be technically feasible in 3 months"
  - "B2C, mobile-first"
  - "Target market: frequent travelers"
- Click "Start Debate"
- Show initial research nodes appearing (Perplexity Sonar)

### 3. Watch the Debate Unfold (2-3 minutes)
- Click "Run Debate Round"
- Show streaming in real-time:
  - **Advocate** argues FOR (green nodes)
  - **Critic** counters (red nodes)
  - **Judge** evaluates and demands evidence (blue nodes)
- Highlight how Judge triggers:
  - Perplexity Sonar research for verification
  - Stagehand scraping for concrete validation
- Show citations appearing in nodes

### 4. Fork the Debate (1 minute)
- Click on a node
- Click "Fork from here"
- Enter: "What if we targeted business travelers instead?"
- Show the branching tree with both paths
- Switch between branches

### 5. Show Final Verdict (1 minute)
- After 3 rounds, show final verdict
- Highlight:
  - Recommendation (pursue/pivot/pass)
  - Score
  - Strengths, weaknesses, risks
  - All citations and evidence

### 6. Prize Highlights (30 seconds)
- **Perplexity Sonar**: "Every research action flows through Sonar - see the citations"
- **Best Agent Reasoning**: "Judge uses 5-step pipeline - evaluate, demand evidence, verify, validate, synthesize"
- **Stagehand**: "Live browser automation validates claims - see Product Hunt scraping"
- **Web Data**: "Combination of Sonar + Stagehand = comprehensive web data pipeline"
- **Vercel**: "Deployed on Vercel with streaming, edge runtime, production-ready"

## Key Talking Points

1. **Multi-agent system** - Three distinct agents with different roles
2. **Real-time research** - Perplexity Sonar powers all research
3. **Concrete validation** - Stagehand scrapes real websites
4. **Visual exploration** - Fork and explore like git branches
5. **Production-ready** - Deployed on Vercel, streaming, edge-optimized

## Backup Demo Ideas

If live demo fails, show:
1. Pre-recorded video of debate flow
2. Screenshots of key features
3. Walk through the code structure
4. Show API responses in browser dev tools

## Demo Ideas to Try

1. **Travel Packing AI** (main demo)
2. **AI Tutor for Kids** (alternative)
3. **Local Food Delivery App** (alternative)

## Tips

- Keep it under 7 minutes
- Focus on the visual tree and streaming
- Emphasize the multi-step reasoning
- Show citations and evidence prominently
- Be ready to explain the architecture if asked
